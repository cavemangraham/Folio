	<p>I currently live in <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=New+Jersey&defid=910050" target="_blank">New Jersey</a> and own a potted plant named Lucy.<br><br>

	I'm a hard-working young guy with an interest in building fantastic interactive experiences. I recently spent three weeks backpacking through Thailand and still hate Thai food. So there's that.<br><br>

	When it comes to front end development I play well with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I use tools such as SASS, Git, and the excellent Emmet plugin for Sublime Text because frankly they're all amazing tools that make life easier.<br><br>

	On the the backend I have the most experience with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and MySQL. I use Jekyll for my static sites(like this one) and Cucumber for testing. <br><br>

	I love to hit the ground running on a new project or a wild idea and work best in a small, tight-knit team. I believe most problems can be solved with an open mind and an honest conversation. I think technology is our last best chance to change the world positively.
