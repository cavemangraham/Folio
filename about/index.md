<body class="article">
	<p>I currently live in New Jersey and own a potted plant named Lucy.<br><br>

	I'm a hard-working young guy with an interest in building fantastic interactive experiences. I recently spent three weeks backpacking through Thailand and still hate Thai food.<br><br>

	When it comes to frontend development I play well with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. I use tools such as SASS, Git, and the excellent Emmet plugin for Sublime Text because frankly they're all amazing tools that make life easier.<br><br>

	On the the backend I have the most experience with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and MySQL. I use Jekyll for my static sites(like this one) and Cucumber for testing. <br><br>

	I love to hit the ground running on a new project or a wild idea and work best in small, tight-knit teams. I believe most problems can be solved with an open mind and an honest conversation. I think the technology is our last best chance to change the world positively.
